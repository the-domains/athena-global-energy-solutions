## Hazardous Hearths

Those of us living in developed nations often take for granted the modern conveniences we've become accustomed to. Take, for example, the methods we use to prepare our meals -- we have the luxury of conjuring cooking heat at the push of a button, without the need to gather or purchase large quantities of fuel.  We can cook inside our homes safely, without the danger of smoke inhalation associated with traditional cooking methods.

However, while many of us enjoy easy access to modern cooking solutions, roughly 40% of the world's population still cooks all of their meals over an open flame. Their cooking fires generally follow the same basic design wherein a tripod built of stones supports the cooking pot over an open fire that requires constant vigilance and copious amounts of wood.

This rudimentary design poses several problems, particularly for people in developing or underprivileged locales:

**Health & Safety Risks**

* Household air pollution from traditional cooking causes 4.3 million deaths each year - more than HIV, TB, and Malaria combined.
* The frequency of child deaths resulting from burns is over 7 times higher in low- and middle-income countries (where traditional cooking methods are used) than in high-income countries.

**Economic Challenges**

* Families living in developing countries spend as much as 30% of their income on cooking fuel.
* The task of gathering fuel for the cooking fire is not onlyexpensive,but time-consuming as well. If fuel resources are scarce in a particular area, residents must make lengthy treks several times a week to obtain the necessary wood for fuel.

**Social Factors**

* A significant portion of each day is spent tending the cookfire -- trying to maintain the proper temperature and constantly feeding the fire with large quantities of wood.

**Environmental Concerns**

* Reliance on wood as a primary fuel source has caused widespread deforestation in many areas.

## Clean Cooking Solutions

AGES is now working with a company that has developed multiple models of "clean" cookstoves designed to provide a better option for people who rely on traditional open-flame cooking for all of their meal preparation.  

"Clean" cookstoves utilize fuel much more efficiently than traditional open-flame cooking methods. They require much, MUCH less fuel to achieve the same or greater amount of cooking heat. While traditional cookfires require piles of wood to maintain, the same meal cooked on one of these clean cookstoves can be prepared using only a handful of twigs or a few charcoal briquettes. Fuel costs can be reduced by 50%, which is meaningful to families in developing countries that may dedicate a third of their household income to fuel costs! ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4bc7f898-53df-4dcc-afdb-eb63ef23d73a.jpg)

In addition to this reduction, this technology reduces cooking times by up to 60%, freeing up several hours every day to be used for family time, recreation, school, work, or housework.

Because these clean cookstoves generate very little smoke, they are safer for indoor use, reducing the dangers associated with smoke inhalation, as well as the risk of house fires and burn injuries.

These cookstoves are already being used in communities across several continents. The cost for a single unit can be as low as $15; with an average lifespan of 5 years, this presents an affordable option for even the lowest-income communities.
