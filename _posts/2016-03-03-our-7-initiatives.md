# OUR 7 INITIATIVES

Since its inception, AGES has explored every technology, business opportunity, potential project, and relationship with an open mind and architecture. This flexible, organic approach to business has allowed AGES to evolve rapidly from a company focused on the market potential of a handful of exciting, new technologies into a company with a greater purpose. AGES now attracts new technologies from all over the world, identifies compatible technologies and develops them into complete, integrated solutions to address a number of critical issues. AGES then acts as the conduit by which these solutions reach established and developing markets.

With all of the different technologies at our disposal and the seemingly infinite ways they can be combined, it became necessary for us to identify specific initiatives that each solution would be designed to serve. AGES has chosen to focus our efforts on SEVEN essential initiatives representing some of the most pressing global crises of our time:

* [Energy][0]
* [Water][1]
* [Food/Farming][2]
* [Sustainable Infrastructure][3]
* [Affordable Homes][4]
* [Health][5]
* [Education][6]
