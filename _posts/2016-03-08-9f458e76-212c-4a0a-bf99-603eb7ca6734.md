## Solar Farm Project

Sustainable energy is _THE _hot topic worldwide, but particularly in developing nations where access to electricity is scarce and sporadic.  In Africa, where sunlight is abundant and the need for energy is great, solar energy is an obvious solution.

Earlier this year, East Africa's first commercial-scale solar plant was built in the Rwamagana District of Rwanda (image above).  At 8.5 MW, this currently represents the continent's largest solar field outside of South Africa and Mauritius.  This region is currently in the midst of a rapid expansion of its electrical grid, and the opportunity this presents to companies engaged in the advancement of alternative energy technologies is profound.  

We are excited to announce that AGES has bid for a 10 MWh energy storage solution as part of a new 50 MW commercial-scale solar farm (that's roughly _6 times larger _than the one in the above photo) underway in Rwanda.  This new solar project would increase the country's grid capacity by 35 percent!  It would also represent one of the largest energy storage solutions on the African continent to date. Our team is negotiating directly with Rwanda's President Kagame and the country's ministers of energy, finance, and infrastructure regarding this initiative.
