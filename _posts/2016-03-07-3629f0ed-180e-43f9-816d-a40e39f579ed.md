## Treating Water With Electricity
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8f9223e8-74bb-407d-bf8b-bf19f964cb44.jpg)

Electrocoagulation (EC), the passing of electrical current through water, has proven very effective in the removal of contaminants from water.  EC systems have been in existence for over 100 years, using a variety of anode and cathode geometries, including plates, balls, fluidized bed spheres, wire mesh, rods, and tubes.

AGES offers several advanced water purification technologies to accommodate a wide range of applications.  The EC technology we utilize in our water treatment solutions represents the next evolution in water purification.  This technology, developed by one of our partner companies, surpasses the established EC model, boasting increased contaminant removal rates and lower capital and operating costs.
