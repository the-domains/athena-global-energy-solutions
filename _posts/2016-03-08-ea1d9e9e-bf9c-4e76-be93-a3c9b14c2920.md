## Municipal Wastewater Treatment
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fe154dfc-4220-4c3f-8717-694eac0db615.jpg)

The Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) was established as a guide for regulating the discharge of wastewater in the United States to ensure that all communities have clean water. More than 75% of the country's population is served by centralized municipal wastewater treatment (WWT) plants. The primary goal of these WWTs is to eliminate contaminants from wastewater discharge. The CWA sets the minimum standard requirements for discharged wastewater.

One technology AGES makes available through our partner companies enables WWTs to produce cleaner discharges than required by EPA guidelines. What is even more impressive is that this particular water treatment technology uses no harsh chemicals, can eliminate a wide range of contaminants from wastewater, is easily incorporated into established WWT operations, and is very cost-effective.

AGES is currently in discussions with representatives from several municipalities about incorporating this technology into their centralized WWT plants. Incorporating these and other technologies, testing has already been conducted proving the effectiveness of this new technology. Below, you can read more about one of the companies that we have partnered with to make this wastewater treatment solution possible, as well as a synopsis of the laboratory tests performed on wastewater treated with this new technology.
